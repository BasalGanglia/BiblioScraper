@article{zeng2009survey,
	Abstract = {Automated analysis of human affective behavior has attracted increasing attention from researchers in psychology, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, and related disciplines. However, the existing methods typically handle only deliberately displayed and exaggerated expressions of prototypical emotions despite the fact that deliberate behaviour differs in visual appearance, audio profile, and timing from spontaneously occurring behaviour. To address this problem, efforts to develop algorithms that can process naturally occurring human affective behaviour have recently emerged. Moreover, an increasing number of efforts are reported toward multimodal fusion for human affect analysis including audiovisual fusion, linguistic and paralinguistic fusion, and multi-cue visual fusion based on facial expressions, head movements, and body gestures. This paper introduces and surveys these recent advances. We first discuss human emotion perception from a psychological perspective. Next we examine available approaches to solving the problem of machine understanding of human affective behavior, and discuss important issues like the collection and availability of training and test data. We finally outline some of the scientific and engineering challenges to advancing human affect sensing technology.},

@article{brouwer2015using,
	Abstract = {Estimating cognitive or affective state from neurophysiological signals and designing applications that make use of this information requires expertise in many disciplines such as neurophysiology, machine learning, experimental psychology, and human factors. This makes it difficult to perform research that is strong in all its aspects as well as to judge a study or application on its merits. On the occasion of the special topic ``Using neurophysiological signals that reflect cognitive or affective state'' we here summarize often occurring pitfalls and recommendations on how to avoid them, both for authors (researchers) and readers. They relate to defining the state of interest, the neurophysiological processes that are expected to be involved in the state of interest, confounding factors, inadvertently ``cheating'' with classification analyses, insight on what underlies successful state estimation, and finally, the added value of neurophysiological measures in the context of an application. We hope that this paper will support the community in producing high quality studies and well-validated, useful applications.},

However, there are limitations to the method itself and room for misinterpretation. This paper introduces psychophysiology, and also shows how research methods psychophysiology offer can be used for HCI research, advantages and disadvantages of using research tools from psychophysiology.},

@article{Dirican2011,
abstract = {This paper reviews psychophysiological measures applied in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) by mainly focusing on studies related to human cognitive states. Although they have their own disadvantages, psychophysiological measures provide a promising way of user understanding to areas that seek “a sixth sense” for user psychological changes like HCI. We first briefly present the related literature and the major cognitive state assessment measurements. Then, fundamentals of psychophysiological measures are focused in-detail. We provide detailed information concerning their diagnosticity and sensitivity to human cognitive processes in table form. Finally, the paper discusses latest applications and point on the possible future directions.},
