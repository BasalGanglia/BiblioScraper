@article{Kramer1983,
abstract = {Current concerns in the assessment of mental workload are discussed, and the event-related brain potential (ERP) is introduced as a promising mental-workload index. Subjects participated in a series of studies in which they were required to perform a target acquisition task while also covertly counting either auditory or visual probes. The effects of several task-difficulty manipulations on the P300 component of the ERP elicited by the counted stimulus probes were investigated. With sufficiently practiced subjects the amplitude of the P300 was found to decrease with increases in task difficulty. The second experiment also provided evidence that the P300 is selectively sensitive to task-relevant attributes. A third experiment demonstrated a convergence in the amplitude of the P300s elicited in the simple and difficult versions of the tracking task. The amplitude of the P300 was also found to covary with the measures of tracking performance. The results of the series of three experiments illustrate the sensitivity of the P300 to the processing requirements of a complex target acquisition task. The findings are discussed in terms of the multidimensional nature of processing resources.},

@article{Sirevaag1993,
abstract = {This research examined the processing demands imposed upon experienced pilots by two different communication formats, digital and verbal, in a high fidelity simulation of an advanced multi-function helicopter. The mental workload imposed by the type and magnitude of communications was assessed by a battery of subjective, performance, secondary, and physiological measures. The performance data indicated that the pilots had difficulty adhering to the Nap of the Earth altitude criterion with high communication demands, particularly with the digital communication system. This was presumably due to the requirement to spend more time scanning the multi-function displays with the digital than with the verbal communication system. On the other hand, the pilots were less prone to task shedding when they used the digital communication system possibly due to the provision of a permanent list of queries that was unavailable with the verbal system. Measures of heart rate variability and blink rate were larger with the verbal than with the digital system, presumably reflecting increased respiratory demands in the verbal condition as well as increased visual processing demands with the digital format. Finally, the probe evoked P300 component decreased in amplitude as a function of increases in the magnitude of communications. The results are discussed in terms of the structural and capacity demands of the communications systems that were proposed for the advanced multi-function helicopter.},

@article{Ullsperger2001,
abstract = {Performance monitoring can be implemented in the brain by two possible systems, one monitoring for response competition or one detecting errors. Two current models of performance monitoring have different views on these monitoring subsystems. While the error detection model proposes a specific error detection system, the response competition model denies the necessity of a specific error detector and favors a more general unitary system evaluating response conflict. Both models suggest that the frontomedian wall in the vicinity of the anterior cingulate sulcus plays an important role in performance monitoring. The present study investigates the hemodynamic and electrophysiological correlates of response competition and error processing. Twelve young healthy participants performed a speeded, modified flanker task, while fMRI signals and ERPs were measured in separate sessions. The event-related fMRI shows that networks involving the frontomedian wall are activated during both response competition and error processing. However, an anatomical dissociation was found: While error processing preferentially activates the human homologue of the cingulate motor area (CMA, BA 24c') in the depth of the anterior cingulate sulcus, response competition is accompanied by activation of the pre-SMA and mesial BA 8. The ERP waveforms for erroneous trials exhibit a large error-related negativity, which is most likely generated in the CMA. These results suggest that the CMA plays a major role in error processing. Further fMRI activations in the lateral prefrontal and primary motor cortex are discussed with respect to performance monitoring and its influence on task set reconfiguration.},

@article{Trejo1995,
abstract = {We evaluated event-related potentials (ERP) as indices of performance in three visual display-monitoring tasks: 1.(a) signal detection,2.(b) running memory and3.(c) computation. Using factor analysis, we developed a global measure of performance (PF1) for each task. Task-relevant and irrelevant-probe stimuli elicited ERPs, which included components P1, N1, P2, P300, slow waves, and fronto-central negativities. In tasks (a) and (b), P300 amplitude in the task-relevant ERPs increased when the task was engaged, and was greater for accuratethan for inaccurate-response trials. In tasks (a) and (c), the irrelevant-probe ERPs also differed among task and performance conditions. To relate ERP measures to PF1, we developed linear regression models distinguished by three factors: General versus individual-subject, stimulus relevance, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Model accuracy and reliability were highest for individual-subject, relevant-stimulus and high-SNR models, where average R2 values for the three tasks were 0.44, 0.46, and 0.38, respectively. We discuss implications of the models for performance monitoring and implications of the ERP effects for human information processing.},
