	Abstract = {We hypothesized that control processes, as measured using electrophysiological (EEG) variables, influence the rate of learning of complex tasks. Specifically, we measured alpha power, event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), and event-related brain potentials during early training of the Space Fortress task, and correlated these measures with subsequent learning rate and performance in transfer tasks. Once initial score was partialled out, the best predictors were frontal alpha power and alpha and delta ERSPs, but not P300. By combining these predictors, we could explain about 50\% of the learning rate variance and 10\%--20\% of the variance in transfer to other tasks using only pretraining EEG measures. Thus, control processes, as indexed by alpha and delta EEG oscillations, can predict learning and skill improvements. The results are of potential use to optimize training regimes.},

@article{cowley_learning_2014,
	Abstract = {Motivated by the link between play and learning, proposed in literature to have a neurobiological basis, we study the electroencephalogram and associated psychophysiology of ``learning game'' players. Forty-five players were tested for topic comprehension by a questionnaire administered before and after solo playing of the game Peacemaker (Impact Games 2007), during which electroencephalography and other physiological signals were measured. Play lasted for one hour, with a break at half time. We used the Bloom taxonomy to distinguish levels of difficulty in demonstrated learning---with the first five levels assigned to fixed questions---and ``gain'' scores to measure actual value of demonstrated learning. We present the analysis of the physiological signals recorded during game play and their relationship to learning scores. Main effects related to biomarkers of vigilance and motivation---including decreased delta power and relatively balanced fronto-hemispheric alpha power---predicted learning at the analysed Bloom levels. Results suggest multiple physiological dispositions that support on-task learning styles, and highlight the utility of the psychophysiological method for interpreting game-based learning evaluations.Video abstractRead the transcriptWatch the video on YouTube},

	Abstract = {The existence of a prominent electroencephalogram (EEG) activity within the theta frequency range (4--7 Hz) in the hippocampus has been one of the most studied rhythmic activities of the mammalian brain. However, in lower mammals the hippocampal EEG has a wider frequency range and may extend from 3 to 4 Hz up to 10 to 12 Hz. Therefore, it has become current practice to name this EEG activity Rhythmic Slow Activity (RSA), in order to avoid the term theta rhythm, which does not cover the entire frequency range within which the hippocampal EEG of lower animals may fall. Several reviews on RSA, particularly in relation to behavior, have appeared (Ishizuka et al., 1990; Komisaruk, 1977; Lopes da Silva and Arnolds, 1978; Robinson, 1980; Vanderwolf and Robinson, 1981). Robinson (1980) discussed in particular the influence of species differences on RSA. In this respect, a controversial point is whether hippocampal RSA occurs also in humans. Single cases have been reported in which hippocampal RSA was observed in man (Giaquinto, 1973), but Halgren et al. (1985) were not able to find RSA in recordings in humans. However, using spectral analysis, Arnolds et al. (1980) were able to demonstrate RSA in the hippocampus of epileptic patients. This RSA presented a dominant low frequency (about 3--4 Hz), which was modulated with behavior in a similar way as in lower mammals.},

	Abstract = {This research examines mood as a collective property of work groups. We argue that work group members experience group moods when they can detect and display mood information through observable behavioral expressions. To test the hypothesis that work group moods are manifested behaviorally, we developed an observational instrument and compared observers' reports of work group mood with self-reported measures from 70 work groups. As predicted, groups converged for eight distinct mood categories, and observers' reports of work group mood were consistent with groups' aggregated self-reported values. Convergence in members' moods was positively associated with task and social interdependence, membership stability, and mood regulation norms. Theoretical and practical implications of work group mood are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been performed on long-term electrocardiography (ECG) recordings (12{\textasciitilde}24 hours) and short-term recordings (2{\textasciitilde}5 minutes), which may not capture momentary change of HRV. In this study, we present a new method to analyze the momentary HRV (mHRV). The ECG recordings were segmented into a series of overlapped HRV analysis windows with a window length of 5 minutes and different time increments. The performance of the proposed method in delineating the dynamics of momentary HRV measurement was evaluated with four commonly used time courses of HRV measures on both synthetic time series and real ECG recordings from human subjects and dogs. Our results showed that a smaller time increment could capture more dynamical information on transient changes. Considering a too short increment such as 10 s would cause the indented time courses of the four measures, a 1-min time increment (4-min overlapping) was suggested in the analysis of mHRV in the study. ECG recordings from human subjects and dogs were used to further assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. The pilot study demonstrated that the proposed analysis of mHRV could provide more accurate assessment of the dynamical changes in cardiac activity than the conventional measures of HRV (without time overlapping). The proposed method may provide an efficient means in delineating the dynamics of momentary HRV and it would be worthy performing more investigations.},

	Abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis over very short ({\textless}60 s) periods may be useful for monitoring dynamic changes in autonomic nervous system activity where steady-state conditions are not maintained (e.g. during drug administration, or the start or end of exercise). From the 1980s there has been a wealth of HRV indices produced in the quest for better measures of the change in parasympathetic and sympathetic activity. Many of the indices have been sparingly used and have not been investigated for application to short-term use. This study surveyed published methods of HRV analysis searching for indices that could be applied to very short time HRV analysis. The survey included measures of time domain, frequency domain, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, Poincar{\'e} plot, and heart rate characteristics. Indices were tested with short segments of archived data to remove those that produced invalid results, or were mathematically equivalent to, but less well known than other indices. The survey identified a comprehensive list of 115 indices that were subsequently coded and screened. Of these, 70 were unique and produced a finite number with 60 s data, so are included in the Toolbox. These indices require validation against physiological data before they can be applied to short-term HRV analysis of cardiac autonomic nervous system activity.},

	Abstract = {In the context of HRV analysis, we evaluated the information content of two measures that can easily be derived from the classical RR time-domain indexes. The two measures are: 1) the ratio sd/rmssd, where sd is the RR standard deviation and rmssd is the root mean square of squared differences of consecutive RR beats; and 2) the ratio sd2/sd1, where sd2 and sd1 are extracted from the Poincar{\'e} plot and represent the transversal and longitudinal dispersion of the cloud of points (RRi,RRi +1). We compared the performance of the two measures with that of the classical LF/HF ratio in a group of healthy subjects who underwent a 70$\,^{\circ}$ upright tilt test. The goodness of the results obtained by the two measures, the simplicity of their calculation and their applicability free from a priori assumptions on the characteristics of the data are proposed to the attention of the community involved in the HRV analysis as a possible alternative to the LF/HF ratio.},

	Abstract = {Background In the present paper, we describe a model of neurovisceral integration in which a set of neural structures involved in cognitive, affective, and autonomic regulation are related to heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance. Methods We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to HRV in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. Conclusion These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in HRV in a wider range of situations and populations.},

@article{lane_neural_2009,
	Abstract = {The vagal (high frequency [HF]) component of heart rate variability (HRV) predicts survival in post-myocardial infarction patients and is considered to reflect vagal antagonism of sympathetic influences. Previous studies of the neural correlates of vagal tone involved mental stress tasks that included cognitive and emotional elements. To differentiate the neural substrates of vagal tone due to emotion, we correlated HF-HRV with measures of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) derived from positron emission tomography (PET) and 15O-water in 12 healthy women during different emotional states. Happiness, sadness, disgust and three neutral conditions were each induced by film clips and recall of personal experiences (12 conditions). Inter-beat intervals derived from electrocardiographic recordings during the 60-second scans were spectrally-analyzed, generating 12 separate measures of HF-HRV in each subject. The six emotion and six neutral conditions were grouped together and contrasted. We observed substantial overlap between emotion-specific rCBF and the correlation between emotion-specific rCBF and HF-HRV, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex. Emotion-specific rCBF also correlated with HF-HRV in the caudate nucleus, periacqueductal gray and left mid-insula. We also observed that the elements of cognitive control inherent in this experiment (that involved focusing on the target mental state) had definable neural substrates that correlated with HF-HRV and to a large extent differed from the emotion-specific correlates of HF-HRV. No statistically significant asymmetries were observed. Our findings are consistent with the view that the medial visceromotor network is a final common pathway by which emotional and cognitive functions recruit autonomic support.},

	Abstract = {Chronic media multitasking is quickly becoming ubiquitous, although processing multiple incoming streams of information is considered a challenge for human cognition. A series of experiments addressed whether there are systematic differences in information processing styles between chronically heavy and light media multitaskers. A trait media multitasking index was developed to identify groups of heavy and light media multitaskers. These two groups were then compared along established cognitive control dimensions. Results showed that heavy media multitaskers are more susceptible to interference from irrelevant environmental stimuli and from irrelevant representations in memory. This led to the surprising result that heavy media multitaskers performed worse on a test of task-switching ability, likely due to reduced ability to filter out interference from the irrelevant task set. These results demonstrate that media multitasking, a rapidly growing societal trend, is associated with a distinct approach to fundamental information processing.},

@article{khan_local_2013,
	Abstract = {Long-range cortical functional connectivity is often reduced in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the nature of local cortical functional connectivity in ASD has remained elusive. We used magnetoencephalography to measure task-related local functional connectivity, as manifested by coupling between the phase of alpha oscillations and the amplitude of gamma oscillations, in the fusiform face area (FFA) of individuals diagnosed with ASD and typically developing individuals while they viewed neutral faces, emotional faces, and houses. We also measured task-related long-range functional connectivity between the FFA and the rest of the cortex during the same paradigm. In agreement with earlier studies, long-range functional connectivity between the FFA and three distant cortical regions was reduced in the ASD group. However, contrary to the prevailing hypothesis in the field, we found that local functional connectivity within the FFA was also reduced in individuals with ASD when viewing faces. Furthermore, the strength of long-range functional connectivity was directly correlated to the strength of local functional connectivity in both groups; thus, long-range and local connectivity were reduced proportionally in the ASD group. Finally, the magnitude of local functional connectivity correlated with ASD severity, and statistical classification using local and long-range functional connectivity data identified ASD diagnosis with 90\% accuracy. These results suggest that failure to entrain neuronal assemblies fully both within and across cortical regions may be characteristic of ASD.},

	Abstract = {Psychophysical measurements indicate that human subjects can store approximately seven short-term memories. Physiological studies suggest that short-term memories are stored by patterns of neuronal activity. Here it is shown that activity patterns associated with multiple memories can be stored in a single neural network that exhibits nested oscillations similar to those recorded from the brain. Each memory is stored in a different high-frequency ("40 hertz") subcycle of a low-frequency oscillation. Memory patterns repeat on each low-frequency (5 to 12 hertz) oscillation, a repetition that relies on activity-dependent changes in membrane excitability rather than reverberatory circuits. This work suggests that brain oscillations are a timing mechanism for controlling the serial processing of short-term memories.},

	Abstract = {Cortical oscillatory synchrony in the gamma range has been attracting increasing attention in cognitive neuroscience ever since being proposed as a solution to the so-called binding problem. This growing literature is critically reviewed in both its basic neuroscience and cognitive aspects. A physiological ``default assumption'' regarding these oscillations is introduced, according to which they signal a state of physiological activation of cortical tissue, and the associated need to balance excitation with inhibition in particular. As such these oscillations would belong among a variety of generic neural control operations that enable neural tissue to perform its systems level functions, without implementing those functions themselves. Regional control of cerebral blood flow provides an analogy in this regard, and gamma oscillations are tightly correlated with this even more elementary control operation. As correlates of neural activation they will also covary with cognitive activity, and this typically suffices to account for the covariation between gamma activity and cognitive task variables. A number of specific cases of gamma synchrony are examined in this light, including the original impetus for attributing cognitive significance to gamma activity, namely the experiments interpreted as evidence for ``binding by synchrony''. This examination finds no compelling reasons to assign functional roles to oscillatory synchrony in the gamma range beyond its generic functions at the level of infrastructural neural control.},

	Abstract = {Since the first descriptions of sensorimotor rhythms by Berger (1929) and by Jasper and Penfield (1949), the potential role of beta oscillations ({\textasciitilde} 13--30 Hz) in the brain has been intensely investigated. We start this review by showing that experimental studies in humans and monkeys have reached a consensus on the facts that sensorimotor beta power is low during movement, transiently increases after movement end (the ``beta rebound'') and tonically increases during object grasping. Recently, a new surge of studies exploiting more complex sensorimotor tasks including multiple events, such as instructed delay tasks, reveal novel characteristics of beta oscillatory activity. We therefore proceed by critically reviewing also this literature to understand whether modulations of beta oscillations in task epochs other than those during and after movement are consistent across studies, and whether they can be reconciled with a role for beta oscillations in sensorimotor transmission. We indeed find that there are additional processes that also strongly affect sensorimotor beta oscillations, such as visual cue anticipation and processing, fitting with the view that beta oscillations reflect heightened sensorimotor transmission beyond somatosensation. However, there are differences among studies, which may be interpreted more readily if we assume multiple processes, whose effects on the overall measured beta power overlap in time. We conclude that beta oscillations observed in sensorimotor cortex may serve large-scale communication between sensorimotor and other areas and the periphery.},

	Abstract = {Aim of the review
Questions related to the genesis and functional correlates of the brain's alpha oscillations around 10 Hz (Alpha) are one of the fundamental research areas in neuroscience. In recent decades, analysis of this activity has been not only the focus of interest for description of sensory‐cognitive processes, but has also led to trials for establishing new hypotheses.The present review and the companion review aim to constitute an ensemble of ``reasonings and suggestions'' to understand alpha oscillations based on a wide range of accumulated findings rather than a trial to launch a new ``alpha theory''. Surveyed descriptions related to physiology and brain function. The review starts with descriptions of earlier extracellular recordings, field potentials and also considers earlier alpha hypotheses. Analytical descriptions of evoked and event-related responses, event-related desynchronization, the relationship between spontaneous activity and evoked potentials, aging brain, pathology and alpha response in cognitive impairment are in the content of this review. In essence, the gamut of the survey includes a multiplicity of evidence on functional correlates in sensory processing, cognition, memory and vegetative system, including the spinal cord and heart.},

I present arguments supporting the hypothesis that theta rhythms emerge owing to intrinsic cellular properties yet can be entrained by several theta oscillators throughout the brain. I review behavioral correlates of theta rhythms and consider how these correlates inform our understanding of theta rhythms' functions. I discuss recent work suggesting that one function of theta is to package related information within individual theta cycles for more efficient spatial memory processing. Studies examining the role of theta phase precession in spatial memory, particularly sequence retrieval, are also summarized. Additionally, I discuss how interregional coupling of theta rhythms facilitates communication across brain regions. Finally, I conclude by summarizing how theta rhythms may support cognitive operations in the brain, including learning.},

@article{harmony_functional_2013,
	Abstract = {Ample evidence suggests that electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillatory activity is linked to a broad variety of perceptual, sensorimotor, and cognitive operations. However, few studies have investigated the delta band (0.5--3.5 Hz) during different cognitive processes. The aim of this review is to present data and propose the hypothesis that sustained delta oscillations inhibit interferences that may affect the performance of mental tasks, possibly by modulating the activity of those networks that should be inactive to accomplish the task. It is clear that two functionally distinct and potentially competing brain networks can be broadly distinguished by their contrasting roles in attention to the external world vs. the internally directed mentation or concentration. During concentration, EEG delta (1--3.5 Hz) activity increases mainly in frontal leads in different tasks: Mental calculation, semantic tasks, and the Sternberg paradigm. This last task is considered a working memory task, but in neural, as well as phenomenological, terms, working memory can be best understood as attention focused on an internal representation. In the Sternberg task, increases in power in the frequencies from 1 to 3.90 Hz in frontal regions are reported. In a Go/No-Go task, power increases at 1 Hz in both conditions were observed during 100--300 ms in central, parietal and temporal regions. However, in the No-Go condition, power increases were also observed in frontal regions, suggesting its participation in the inhibition of the motor response. Increases in delta power were also reported during semantic tasks in children. In conclusion, the results suggest that power increases of delta frequencies during mental tasks are associated with functional cortical deafferentation, or inhibition of the sensory afferences that interfere with internal concentration. These inhibitory oscillations would modulate the activity of those networks that should be inactive to accomplish the task.},

	Abstract = {Already in his first report on the discovery of the human EEG in 1929, Berger showed great interest in further elucidating the functional roles of the alpha and beta waves for normal mental activities. Meanwhile, most cognitive processes have been linked to at least one of the traditional frequency bands in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma range. Although the existing wealth of high-quality correlative EEG data led many researchers to the conviction that brain oscillations subserve various sensory and cognitive processes, a causal role can only be demonstrated by directly modulating such oscillatory signals. In this review, we highlight several methods to selectively modulate neuronal oscillations, including EEG-neurofeedback, rhythmic sensory stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). In particular, we discuss tACS as the most recent technique to directly modulate oscillatory brain activity. Such studies demonstrating the effectiveness of tACS comprise reports on purely behavioral or purely electrophysiological effects, on combination of behavioral effects with offline EEG measurements or on simultaneous (online) tACS-EEG recordings. Whereas most tACS studies are designed to modulate ongoing rhythmic brain activity at a specific frequency, recent evidence suggests that tACS may also modulate cross-frequency interactions. Taken together, the modulation of neuronal oscillations allows to demonstrate causal links between brain oscillations and cognitive processes and to obtain important insights into human brain function.},

	Abstract = {Why does neuronal activity in sensory brain areas sometimes give rise to perception, and sometimes not? Although neuronal noise is often invoked as the key factor, a portion of this variability could also be due to the history and current state of the brain affecting cortical excitability. Here we directly test this idea by examining whether the phase of prestimulus oscillatory activity is causally linked with modulations of cortical excitability and with visual perception. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over human visual cortex to induce illusory perceptions (phosphenes) while electroencephalograms (EEGs) were simultaneously recorded. Subjects reported the presence or absence of an induced phosphene following a single pulse of TMS at perceptual threshold. The phase of ongoing alpha (∼10 Hz) oscillations within 400 ms before the pulse significantly covaried with the perceptual outcome. This effect was observed in occipital regions around the site of TMS, as well as in a distant frontocentral region. In both regions, we found a systematic relationship between prepulse EEG phase and perceptual performance: Phosphene probability changed by ∼15\% between opposite phases. In summary, we provide direct evidence for a chain of causal relations between the phase of ongoing oscillations, neuronal excitability, and visual perception: Ongoing oscillations create periodic ``windows of excitability,'' with sensory perception being more likely to occur at specific phases.},

	Abstract = {The effects of the changes in the frequency spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) on the perception of near-threshold visual stimuli and on the event-related potentials (ERPs) produced by these stimuli were investigated on 12 healthy volunteers. The stimulus intensity, at which each subject could detect 50\% of the presented stimuli, was defined as the sensory threshold for that subject. Single ERP trials were separated into two groups: Trials with detected and undetected stimuli. The ERPs and the average power spectra of the 1 s prestimulus periods were computed for both conditions. P300 amplitudes of the ERPs, and total power and relative band powers of the delta (0.5--4 Hz), theta (4--7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5--13 Hz), beta (13--30 Hz), and gamma (30--70 Hz) frequency bands of the prestimulus power spectra were measured. Between the two conditions, a specific difference was observed in the relative power of the alpha band, which was significantly lower before detected stimuli (p\&lt;0.01) in line with significantly higher amplitudes of the ERPs (p\&lt;0.001). These results show that short-lasting changes in brain's excitability state are reflected the relative alpha power of the EEG, which may explain significant variability in perceptual processes and ERP generation especially at boundary conditions such as sensory threshold.},

Visual contact among participants was manipulated. Physiological compliance was scored with weighted coherence and cross correlation.

While social--visual contact did not have an impact, physiological compliance was predictive of improved performance, with coherence robust over all three physiological measures. Heart cross correlation showed the strongest predictive relationships. These results provide evidence that physiological compliance among team members may benefit team performance.

	Abstract = {Pregnant mothers often report a special awareness of and bonding with their unborn child. Little is known about this relationship although it may offer potential for the assessment of the fetal condition. Recently we found evidence of short epochs of fetal--maternal heart rate synchronization under uncontrolled conditions with spontaneous maternal breathing. Here, we examine whether the occurrence of such epochs can be influenced by maternal respiratory arrhythmia induced by paced breathing at several different rates (10, 12, 15, and 20 cycles per minute). To test for such weak and nonstationary synchronizations among the fetal--maternal subsystems, we apply a multivariate synchronization analysis technique and test statistics based on twin surrogates. We find a clear increase in synchronization epochs mostly at high maternal respiratory rates in the original but not in the surrogate data. On the other hand, fewer epochs are found at low respiratory rates both in original and surrogate data. The results suggest that the fetal cardiac system seems to possess the capability to adjust its rate of activation in response to external---i.e., maternal---stimulation. Hence, the pregnant mothers' special awareness to the unborn child may also be reflected by fetal--maternal interaction of cardiac activity. Our approach opens up the chance to examine this interaction between independent but closely linked physiological systems.},

	Abstract = {Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulation technique with promising results for enhancing cognitive information processes. So far, however, research has mainly focused on the effects of tDCS on cognitive control operations for non-emotional material. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the effects on cognitive control considering negative versus positive material. For this sham-controlled, within-subjects study, we selected a homogeneous sample of twenty-five healthy participants. By using behavioral measures and event related potentials (ERP) as indexes, we aimed to investigate whether a single session of anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) would have specific effects in enhancing cognitive control for positive and negative valenced stimuli. After tDCS over the left DLPFC (and not sham control stimulation), we observed more negative N450 amplitudes along with faster reaction times when inhibiting a habitual response to happy compared to sad facial expressions. Gender did not influence the effects of tDCS on cognitive control for emotional information. In line with the Valence Theory of side-lateralized activity, this stimulation protocol might have led to a left dominant (relative to right) prefrontal cortical activity, resulting in augmented cognitive control specifically for positive relative to negative stimuli. To verify that tDCS induces effects that are in line with all aspects of the well known Valence Theory, future research should investigate the effects of tDCS over the left vs. right DLPFC on cognitive control for emotional information.},

This study proposes the utilization of a deep learning network (DLN) to discover unknown feature correlation between input signals that is crucial for the learning task. The DLN is implemented with a stacked autoencoder (SAE) using hierarchical feature learning approach. Input features of the network are power spectral densities of 32-channel EEG signals from 32 subjects. To alleviate overfitting problem, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to extract the most important components of initial input features. Furthermore, covariate shift adaptation of the principal components is implemented to minimize the nonstationary effect of EEG signals. Experimental results show that the DLN is capable of classifying three different levels of valence and arousal with accuracy of 49.52\&\#x25; and 46.03\&\#x25;, respectively. Principal component based covariate shift adaptation enhances the respective classification accuracy by 5.55\&\#x25; and 6.53\&\#x25;. Moreover, DLN provides better performance compared to SVM and naive Bayes classifiers.},

	Abstract = {Empathy is a multi-dimensional concept allowing humans to understand the emotions of others and respond adaptively from a social perspective. This mental process, essential to social interactions, has attracted the attention of many scholars from different fields of study but the blooming interest for empathy in cognitive neurosciences has rekindled this interest. This paper reviews the growing literature stemming from studies using brain stimulation techniques that have investigated directly or indirectly the different components of empathy, including resonance, self-other discrimination, and mentalizing. Some studies have also ventured toward the modulation of this complex process and toward the investigation of different components in populations that show reduced empathic skills. We argue that brain stimulation techniques have the potential to make a unique contribution to the field of empathy research with their exclusive capacity, compared to other brain imaging techniques, to modulate the neural systems involved in the distinct components of this process. Provided the development of innovative ecological paradigms that will put people in actual social interactions as well as comprehensive and adaptive models that can integrate research from different domains, the ultimate goal of this research domain is to devise protocols that can modulate empathy in people with developmental, neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Novel methods for neuronal entrainment [1--4] provide the unique opportunity to modulate perceptually relevant brain oscillations [5, 6] in a frequency-specific manner and to study their functional impact on distinct cognitive functions. Recently, evidence has emerged that tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation) can modulate cortical oscillations [7--9]. However, the study of electrophysiological effects has been hampered so far by the absence of concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Here, we applied 10 Hz tACS to the parieto-occipital cortex and utilized simultaneous EEG recordings to study neuronal entrainment during stimulation. We pioneer a novel approach for simultaneous tACS-EEG recordings and successfully separate stimulation artifacts from ongoing and event-related cortical activity. Our results reveal that 10 Hz tACS increases parieto-occipital alpha activity and synchronizes cortical oscillators with similar intrinsic frequencies to the entrainment frequency. Additionally, we demonstrate that tACS modulates target detection performance in a phase-dependent fashion highlighting the causal role of alpha oscillations for visual perception.},

Convincing evidence supporting those associations has been provided by studies using intracranial stimulation, pharmacological interventions and lesion studies. The emergence of novel non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) now allows to modulate brain oscillations directly. Particularly, tACS offers the unique opportunity to causally link brain oscillations of a specific frequency range to cognitive processes, because it uses sinusoidal currents that are bound to one frequency only. Using tACS allows to modulate brain oscillations and in turn to influence cognitive processes, thereby demonstrating the causal link between the two. Here, we review findings about the physiological mechanism of tACS and studies that have used tACS to modulate basic motor and sensory processes as well as higher cognitive processes like memory, ambiguous perception, and decision making.},

@article{schoffelen_source_2009,
	Abstract = {Interactions between functionally specialized brain regions are crucial for normal brain function. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) are techniques suited to capture these interactions, because they provide whole head measurements of brain activity in the millisecond range. More than one sensor picks up the activity of an underlying source. This field spread severely limits the utility of connectivity measures computed directly between sensor recordings. Consequentially, neuronal interactions should be studied on the level of the reconstructed sources. This article reviews several methods that have been applied to investigate interactions between brain regions in source space. We will mainly focus on the different measures used to quantify connectivity, and on the different strategies adopted to identify regions of interest. Despite various successful accounts of MEG and EEG source connectivity, caution with respect to the interpretation of the results is still warranted. This is due to the fact that effects of field spread can never be completely abolished in source space. However, in this very exciting and developing field of research this cautionary note should not discourage researchers from further investigation into the connectivity between neuronal sources.

In addition to examining oscillations in pre-specified bands, interactions and relations between the different frequency bandwidths is another important aspect that needs to be considered in unraveling the workings of the human brain and its functions. In this review we provide evidence that studying interdependencies between brain oscillations may be a valuable approach to study the electrophysiological processes associated with motivation and emotional states. Studies will be presented showing that amplitude-amplitude coupling between delta-alpha and delta-beta oscillations varies as a function of state anxiety and approach-avoidance-related motivation, and that changes in the association between delta-beta oscillations can be observed following successful psychotherapy. Together these studies suggest that cross-frequency coupling of brain oscillations may contribute to expanding our understanding of the neural processes underlying motivation and emotion.},

In particular, the strength of phase-amplitude CFC differs across brain areas in a task-relevant manner, changes quickly in response to sensory, motor and cognitive events, and correlates with performance in learning tasks. Importantly, whereas high-frequency brain activity reflects local domains of cortical processing, low-frequency brain rhythms are dynamically entrained across distributed brain regions by both external sensory input and internal cognitive events. CFC might thus serve as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks operating at behavioral timescales to the fast, local cortical processing required for effective computation and synaptic modification, thus integrating functional systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal oscillations of different frequencies can interact in several ways. There has been particular interest in the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, since recent evidence suggests a functional role for this type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Phase-amplitude coupling has been reported in continuous electrophysiological signals obtained from the brain at both local and macroscopic levels. In the present work, we present a new measure for assessing phase-amplitude CFC. This measure is defined as an adaptation of the Kullback--Leibler distance---a function that is used to infer the distance between two distributions---and calculates how much an empirical amplitude distribution-like function over phase bins deviates from the uniform distribution. We show that a CFC measure defined this way is well suited for assessing the intensity of phase-amplitude coupling. We also review seven other CFC measures; we show that, by some performance benchmarks, our measure is especially attractive for this task. We also discuss some technical aspects related to the measure, such as the length of the epochs used for these analyses and the utility of surrogate control analyses. Finally, we apply the measure and a related CFC tool to actual hippocampal recordings obtained from freely moving rats and show, for the first time, that the CA3 and CA1 regions present different CFC characteristics.},

Here, a method for assessing transient cross-frequency coupling is presented, which allows one to test for the presence of multiple, dynamic, and flexible cross-frequency coupling structure over both time and frequency. The method is applied to intracranial EEG data, and strong coupling between gamma (∼40--80 Hz) and upper theta (∼7--9 Hz) was observed.

@article{palva_phase_2005,
	Abstract = {Synchronization of neuronal activity, often associated with network oscillations, is thought to provide a means for integrating anatomically distributed processing in the brain. Neuronal processing, however, involves simultaneous oscillations in various frequency bands. The mechanisms involved in the integration of such spectrally distributed processing have remained enigmatic. We demonstrate, using magnetoencephalography, that robust cross-frequency phase synchrony is present in the human cortex among oscillations with frequencies from 3 to 80 Hz. Continuous mental arithmetic tasks demanding the retention and summation of items in the working memory enhanced the cross-frequency phase synchrony among α (∼10 Hz), β (∼20 Hz), and γ (∼30-40 Hz) oscillations. These tasks also enhanced the ``classical'' within-frequency synchrony in these frequency bands, but the spatial patterns of α, β, and γ synchronies were distinct and, furthermore, separate from the patterns of cross-frequency phase synchrony. Interestingly, an increase in task load resulted in an enhancement of phase synchrony that was most prominent between γ- and α-band oscillations. These data indicate that cross-frequency phase synchrony is a salient characteristic of ongoing activity in the human cortex and that it is modulated by cognitive task demands. The enhancement of cross-frequency phase synchrony among functionally and spatially distinct networks during mental arithmetic tasks posits it as a candidate mechanism for the integration of spectrally distributed processing.},

	Abstract = {Oscillations are an important aspect of neuronal activity. Interestingly, oscillatory patterns are also observed in behaviour, such as in visual performance measures after the presentation of a brief sensory event in the visual or another modality. These oscillations in visual performance cycle at the typical frequencies of brain rhythms, suggesting that perception may be closely linked to brain oscillations. We here investigated this link for a prominent rhythm of the visual system (the alpha-rhythm, 8--12 Hz) by applying rhythmic visual stimulation at alpha-frequency (10.6 Hz), known to lead to a resonance response in visual areas, and testing its effects on subsequent visual target discrimination. Our data show that rhythmic visual stimulation at 10.6 Hz: 1) has specific behavioral consequences, relative to stimulation at control frequencies (3.9 Hz, 7.1 Hz, 14.2 Hz), and 2) leads to alpha-band oscillations in visual performance measures, that 3) correlate in precise frequency across individuals with resting alpha-rhythms recorded over parieto-occipital areas. The most parsimonious explanation for these three findings is entrainment (phase-locking) of ongoing perceptually relevant alpha-band brain oscillations by rhythmic sensory events. These findings are in line with occipital alpha-oscillations underlying periodicity in visual performance, and suggest that rhythmic stimulation at frequencies of intrinsic brain-rhythms can be used to reveal influences of these rhythms on task performance to study their functional roles.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal oscillations in the gamma band (above 30 Hz) have been proposed to be a possible mechanism for the visual representation of objects. The present study examined the topography of gamma band spectral power and event-related potentials in human EEG associated with perceptual switching effected by rotating ambiguous (bistable) figures. Eleven healthy human subjects were presented two rotating bistable figures: First, a face figure that allowed perception of a sad or happy face depending on orientation and therefore caused a perceptual switch at defined points in time when rotated, and, second, a modified version of the Rubin vase, allowing perception as a vase or two faces whereby the switch was orientation-independent. Nonrotating figures served as further control stimuli. EEG was recorded using a high-density array with 128 electrodes. We found a negative event-related potential associated with the switching of the sad--happy figure, which was most pronounced at central prefrontal sites. Gamma band activity (GBA) was enhanced at occipital electrode sites in the rotating bistable figures compared with the standing stimuli, being maximal at vertical stimulus orientations that allowed an easy recognition of the sad and happy face or the vase--faces, respectively. At anterior electrodes, GBA showed a complementary pattern, being maximal when stimuli were oriented horizontally. The findings support the notion that formation of a visual percept may involve oscillations in a distributed neuronal assembly.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce two new features for the design of electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain--Computer Interfaces (BCI): One feature based on multifractal cumulants and the other feature based on the predictive complexity of the EEG time series. The multifractal cumulants feature measures the signal regularity, while the predictive complexity measures the difficulty to predict the future of the signal based on its past, hence a degree of how complex it is. We have conducted an evaluation of the performance of these two novel features on EEG data corresponding to motor-imagery. We also compared them to the gold standard features used in the BCI field, namely the band-power features. We evaluated these three kinds of features and their combinations on EEG signals from 13 subjects. Results obtained show that our novel features can lead to BCI designs with improved classification performance, notably when using and combining the three kinds of feature (band-power, multifractal cumulants, predictive complexity) together.},

	Abstract = {Measures that quantify the relationship between two or more brain signals are drawing attention as neuroscientists explore the mechanisms of large-scale integration that enable coherent behavior and cognition. Traditional Fourier-based measures of coherence have been used to quantify frequency-dependent relationships between two signals. More recently, several off-line studies examined phase-locking value (PLV) as a possible feature for use in brain--computer interface (BCI) systems. However, only a few individuals have been studied and full statistical comparisons among the different classes of features and their combinations have not been conducted. The present study examines the relative BCI performance of spectral power, coherence, and PLV, alone and in combination. The results indicate that spectral power produced classification at least as good as PLV, coherence, or any possible combination of these measures. This may be due to the fact that all three measures reflect mainly the activity of a single signal source (i.e., an area of sensorimotor cortex). This possibility is supported by the finding that EEG signals from different channels generally had near-zero phase differences. Coherence, PLV, and other measures of inter-channel relationships may be more valuable for BCIs that use signals from more than one distinct cortical source.},

	Abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aim at translating brain signals, typically ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG), into commands for external devices. Spatial filters are powerful tools for EEG classification, able to reduce spatial blurring effects. In particular, optimal spatial filters have been designed to classify EEG signals based on band power features. Unfortunately, there are other relevant EEG features for which no optimal spatial filter exists. This is the case for Phase Locking Value (PLV) features, which measure the synchronization between 2 EEG channels. Therefore, this paper proposes to create such a pair of optimal spatial filters for PLV-features. To do so, we optimized a functional measuring the discriminability of PLV-features based on a genetic algorithm. An evaluation of our algorithm on a motor imagery EEG data set showed that using optimized spatial filters led to higher classification performances, and that combining the resulting PLV features with traditional methods boosts the overall BCI performances.},

Among the most popular are logarithmic band power estimates with more or less subject-specific optimization of the frequency bands.

The first setting is defined when no data from a subject is available. In this condition our results show that Time Domain Parameters outperform all band power features tested with all spatial filters applied. The second setting is the transition from calibration (no feedback) to feedback, in which the frequency content of the signals can change for some subjects.

	Abstract = {The quantification of the spectral content of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings has a substantial role in clinical and scientific applications. It is of particular relevance in the analysis of event-related brain oscillatory responses. This work is focused on the identification and quantification of relevant frequency patterns in motor imagery (MI) related EEGs utilized for brain-computer interface (BCI) purposes. The main objective of the paper is to perform comparative analysis of different approaches to spectral signal representation such as power spectral density (PSD) techniques, atomic decompositions, time-frequency (t-f) energy distributions, continuous and discrete wavelet approaches, from which band power features can be extracted and used in the framework of MI classification. The emphasis is on identifying discriminative properties of the feature sets representing EEG trials recorded during imagination of either left- or right-hand movement. Feature separability is quantified in the offline study using the classification accuracy (CA) rate obtained with linear and nonlinear classifiers. PSD approaches demonstrate the most consistent robustness and effectiveness in extracting the distinctive spectral patterns for accurately discriminating between left and right MI induced EEGs. This observation is based on an analysis of data recorded from eleven subjects over two sessions of BCI experiments. In addition, generalization capabilities of the classifiers reflected in their intersession performance are discussed in the paper.},

Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. However, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks. Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.},

@article{winkler_identifying_2015,
	Abstract = {Power modulations of oscillations in electro- and magnetoencephalographic (EEG/MEG) signals have been linked to a wide range of brain functions. To date, most of the evidence is obtained by correlating bandpower fluctuations to specific target variables such as reaction times or task ratings, while the causal links between oscillatory activity and behavior remain less clear. Here, we propose to identify causal relationships by the statistical concept of Granger causality, and we investigate which methods are bests suited to reveal Granger causal links between the power of brain oscillations and experimental variables.

As an alternative to testing such causal links on the sensor level, we propose to linearly combine the information contained in each sensor in order to create virtual channels, corresponding to estimates of underlying brain oscillations, the Granger-causal relations of which may be assessed. Such linear combinations of sensor can be given by source separation methods such as, for example, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) or by the recently developed Source Power Correlation (SPoC) method.

Here we compare Granger causal analysis on power dynamics obtained from i) sensor directly, ii) spatial filtering methods that do not optimize for Granger causality (ICA and SPoC), and iii) a method that directly optimizes spatial filters to extract sources the power dynamics of which maximally Granger causes a given target variable. We refer to this method as Granger Causal Power Analysis (GrangerCPA).

Using both simulated and real EEG recordings, we find that computing Granger causality on channel-wise spectral power suffers from a poor signal-to-noise ratio due to volume conduction, while all three multivariate approaches alleviate this issue. In real EEG recordings from subjects performing self-paced foot movements, all three multivariate methods identify neural oscillations with motor-related patterns at a similar performance level. In an auditory perception task, the application of GrangerCPA reveals significant Granger-causal links between alpha oscillations and reaction times in more subjects compared to conventional methods.},

Each signal presentation was accompanied by subjective scaling of the extent of its emotional impact. EEG traces were recorded in 62 channels as signals were presented. These experiments showed that the degree of emotional impact of the signal was significantly associated with increases in evoked synchronization in the δ, θ1, θ2, β1, β3, and γ ranges and with the effects of combined changes in evoked synchronization and desynchronization in the α2 frequency range. The interhemisphere distribution of evoked changes in power provided evidence that not only the posterior areas of the right hemisphere were involved in analyzing the emotional significance of images, as indicated by changes in evoked θ1 and θ2 synchronization and α2 desynchronization, but also the anterior areas of the left hemisphere, as indicated by changes in evoked θ2 synchronization. From the standpoint of affective chronometry, the earliest discrimination of the emotional content of stimuli, regardless of the sign of the emotion, occurred in the lower θ range and was seen at 0--600 msec after the start of stimulus presentation. This process was delayed to 600--1000 msec in the θ2, α2, and γ ranges.},

We present the first comprehensive and technical review, explaining the evolution of tES in both terminology and dosage over the past 100 years of research to present day. Current transcranial Pulsed Current Stimulation (tPCS) approaches such as Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) descended from Electrosleep (ES) through Cranial Electro-stimulation Therapy (CET), Transcerebral Electrotherapy (TCET), and NeuroElectric Therapy (NET) while others like Transcutaneous Cranial Electrical Stimulation (TCES) descended from Electroanesthesia (EA) through Limoge, and Interferential Stimulation. Prior to a contemporary resurgence in interest, variations of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation were explored intermittently, including Polarizing current, Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS), and Transcranial Micropolarization. The development of these approaches alongside Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) and pharmacological developments are considered. Both the roots and unique features of contemporary approaches such as transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) and transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS) are discussed. Trends and incremental developments in electrode montage and waveform spanning decades are presented leading to the present day. Commercial devices, seminal conferences, and regulatory decisions are noted. We conclude with six rules on how increasing medical and technological sophistication may now be leveraged for broader success and adoption of tES.},

Popular examples are the amygdala in the domain of emotion and the lateral prefrontal cortex in the case of cognition. This prevalent view is problematic for a number of reasons. Here, I will argue that complex cognitive--emotional behaviours have their basis in dynamic coalitions of networks of brain areas, none of which should be conceptualized as specifically affective or cognitive. Central to cognitive--emotional interactions are brain areas with a high degree of connectivity, called hubs, which are critical for regulating the flow and integration of information between regions.},

However, the causal link between these synaptic processes and memory has been difficult to demonstrate. Here we show that fear conditioning, a type of associative memory, can be inactivated and reactivated by LTD and LTP, respectively. We began by conditioning an animal to associate a foot shock with optogenetic stimulation of auditory inputs targeting the amygdala, a brain region known to be essential for fear conditioning. Subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTD conditioning to the auditory input inactivates memory of the shock. Then subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTP conditioning to the auditory input reactivates memory of the shock. Thus, we have engineered inactivation and reactivation of a memory using LTD and LTP, supporting a causal link between these synaptic processes and memory.},

On each trial, a luminance environment was presented for 4 min, followed by participants rated their emotional feelings of the lighting environment. EEG data were recorded during the experiment. Spectral analysis was performed for the range of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma ranges. The participants felt cooler and more pleasant and theta oscillations on the F4, F8, T4, and TP7 electrodes were more enhanced in the direct/indirect lighting environment compared to the direct lighting environment. There was significant correlation between the ``cool'' rating and the theta power of the F8 electrode. The participants felt more pleasant in the direct/indirect lighting environment, indicating that space with direct/indirect lighting modulated subjective perception. Additionally, our results suggest that theta oscillatory activity can be used as a biological marker that reflects emotional status in different lighting environments.},

To date, the primary means of acting on this region has been with pharmacological interventions or implanted electrodes. Here we introduce a new noninvasive brain stimulation technique that exploits the highly interconnected nature of the midbrain and prefrontal cortex to stimulate deep brain regions. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the prefrontal cortex, we were able to remotely activate the interconnected midbrain and cause increases in participants' appraisals of facial attractiveness. Participants with more enhanced prefrontal/midbrain connectivity following stimulation exhibited greater increases in attractiveness ratings. These results illustrate that noninvasive direct stimulation of prefrontal cortex can induce neural activity in the distally connected midbrain, which directly effects behavior. Furthermore, these results suggest that this tDCS protocol could provide a promising approach to modulate midbrain functions that are disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders.},

	Abstract = {Recent evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging suggests that cortical hemodynamic responses coincide in different subjects experiencing a common naturalistic stimulus. Here we utilize neural responses in the electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked by multiple presentations of short film clips to index brain states marked by high levels of correlation within and across subjects. We formulate a novel signal decomposition method which extracts maximally correlated signal components from multiple EEG records. The resulting components capture correlations down to a one-second time resolution, thus revealing that peak correlations of neural activity across viewings can occur in remarkable correspondence with arousing moments of the film. Moreover, a significant reduction in neural correlation occurs upon a second viewing of the film or when the narrative is disrupted by presenting its scenes scrambled in time. We also probe oscillatory brain activity during periods of heightened correlation, and observe during such times a significant increase in the theta band for a frontal component and reductions in the alpha and beta frequency bands for parietal and occipital components. Low-resolution EEG tomography of these components suggests that the correlated neural activity is consistent with sources in the cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. Put together, these results suggest that the observed synchrony reflects attention- and emotion-modulated cortical processing which may be decoded with high temporal resolution by extracting maximally correlated components of neural activity.},

This novel spatial filtering method operates on an array of Fourier coefficients and projects the data into a low-dimensional space in which the trial-to-trial spectral covariance is maximized. When applied to two sample data sets, the resulting technique recovers physiologically plausible components (i.e., the recovered topographies match the lead fields of the underlying sources) while drastically reducing the dimensionality of the data (i.e., more than 90\% of the trial-to-trial reliability is captured in the first four components). Moreover, the proposed technique achieves a higher SNR than that of the single-best electrode or the Principal Components. We provide a freely-available MATLAB implementation of the proposed technique, herein termed "Reliable Components Analysis".},

@article{jessen_glymphatic_2015,
	Abstract = {The glymphatic system is a recently discovered macroscopic waste clearance system that utilizes a unique system of perivascular tunnels, formed by astroglial cells, to promote efficient elimination of soluble proteins and metabolites from the central nervous system. Besides waste elimination, the glymphatic system also facilitates brain-wide distribution of several compounds, including glucose, lipids, amino acids, growth factors, and neuromodulators. Intriguingly, the glymphatic system function mainly during sleep and is largely disengaged during wakefulness. The biological need for sleep across all species may therefore reflect that the brain must enter a state of activity that enables elimination of potentially neurotoxic waste products, including β-amyloid. Since the concept of the glymphatic system is relatively new, we will here review its basic structural elements, organization, regulation, and functions. We will also discuss recent studies indicating that glymphatic function is suppressed in various diseases and that failure of glymphatic function in turn might contribute to pathology in neurodegenerative disorders, traumatic brain injury and stroke.},

	Abstract = {This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the available evidence regarding the effects of non-invasive neurostimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), on craving in substance dependence and craving for high palatable food. Non-invasive neurostimulation techniques were restricted to repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). A total of 17 eligible studies were identified. Random effects analysis revealed a pooled standardized effect size (Hedge's g) of 0.476 (CI: 0.316--0.636), indicating a medium effect size favouring active non-invasive neurostimulation over sham stimulation in the reduction of craving (z = 5.832, p \&lt; 0.001). No significant differences were found between rTMS and tDCS, between the various substances of abuse and between substances of abuse and food, or between left and right DLPFC stimulation. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides the first clear evidence that non-invasive neurostimulation of the DLPFC decreases craving levels in substance dependence.},

@article{gruber_oscillatory_2006,
	Abstract = {Up to today, the neuronal bases of activating and establishing a memory trace are not well understood. Several findings point towards the idea that the activation of an engram is mirrored in induced oscillatory bursts in the gamma frequency range (\&gt; 20 Hz; induced gamma band responses; iGBRs). In the present study, we further investigated this hypothesis. Volunteers performed two tasks on repeated pictures of familiar and unfamiliar objects. They either made a familiarity decision with repetition being task irrelevant (indirect memory task), or a recognition judgment with repetition being task relevant (direct memory task). Furthermore, we complemented iGBR analyses by investigating other brain responses known to be modulated by mnemonic manipulations, namely, evoked gamma oscillations, lower frequency oscillations, and event-related potentials (ERPs). The results obtained for the indirect task replicated previous findings of repetition suppression of iGBRs for repeated familiar stimuli and an increase of iGBRs for repeated unfamiliar objects. These effects might be linked to the `sharpening' of a cell assembly representing a familiar object and to the formation of a new object representation for unfamiliar stimuli, respectively. In contrast, the direct task revealed no repetition-related modulations of iGBRs. Thus, modulations of iGBRs are not a mere automatic consequence of repeated stimulus processing but might rather mirror changes within cortical object representation according to use-dependent plasticity principles. Furthermore, evoked gamma responses, lower frequency bands, and late components of the ERPs correlated with more specific subprocesses during mnemonic functioning.},

Recent studies intervening with these oscillations have demonstrated effective modulation of both the oscillations and behavior. In this review, we collect evidence in favor of how hypothesis-driven methods can be used to augment cognition by optimizing cortical oscillations. We elaborate their potential usefulness for three target groups: Healthy elderly, patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and healthy young adults. We discuss the relevance of neuronal oscillations in each group and show how each of them can benefit from the manipulation of functionally-related oscillations. Further, we describe methods for manipulation of neuronal oscillations including direct brain stimulation as well as indirect task alterations. We also discuss practical considerations about the proposed techniques. In conclusion, we propose that insights from neuroscience should guide techniques to augment human cognition, which in turn can provide a better understanding of how the human brain works.},

Taking this concept further, we review experiments showing that oscillatory phenomena such as alpha, theta, and delta responses to events are, just as the gamma band, strongly interwoven with sensory and cognitive functions. This review argues that selectively distributed delta, theta, alpha and gamma oscillatory systems act as resonant communication networks through large populations of neurons. Thus, oscillatory processes might play a major role in functional communication in the brain in relation to memory and integrative functions.},

	Abstract = {Studies on 30 right-handed subjects addressed EEG characteristics (62 channels) in conditions of laboratory simulation of induced emotions of happiness, joy, anger, disgust, fear/anxiety, and sadness. Induced emotions were found to produce, along with common features, individual patterns in the distribution of amplitude-frequency EEG characteristics. Induced positive and negative discrete emotions were characterized by interhemisphere activatory asymmetry in the theta-2 (4--6 Hz), alpha-2 (10--12 Hz), and beta-1 (12--18 Hz) ranges. Experience of the emotions of joy, anger, and disgust occurred on the background of asymmetrical increases in activity in the anterior cortex of the left hemisphere in the theta-2 range, suggesting a leading role for the activity of these areas in realizing the cognitive components of emotional reacting. In addition, some high-ergicity negative emotions evoked combined alpha-2 and beta-1 desynchronization (disgust) or beta-1 desynchronization (fear/anxiety) in the right parietal-temporal cortex, suggesting its involvement in the mechanisms of non-specific emotional activation. These data provide evidence that each of these emotions is characterized by its own individual pattern in the distribution of the amplitude-frequency characteristics of the EEG and, on the other hand, that series of ranges and cortical areas show similar but different (in terms of intensity) effects in response to emotional activation for emotions of different flavor.},

	Abstract = {Objective: The present study aimed at examining the time course and topography of oscillatory brain activity and event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to laterally presented affective pictures. Methods: Electroencephalography was recorded from 129 electrodes in 10 healthy university students during presentation of pictures from the international affective picture system. Frequency measures and ERPs were obtained for pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures. Results: In accordance with previous reports, a modulation of the late positive ERP wave at parietal recording sites was found as a function of emotional arousal. Early mid gamma band activity (GBA; 30--45 Hz) at 80 ms post-stimulus was enhanced in response to aversive stimuli only, whereas the higher GBA (46--65 Hz) at 500 ms showed an enhancement of arousing, compared to neutral pictures. ERP and late gamma effects showed a pronounced right-hemisphere preponderance, but differed in terms of topographical distribution. Conclusions: Late gamma activity may represent a correlate of widespread cortical networks processing different aspects of emotionally arousing visual objects. In contrast, differences between affective categories in early gamma activity might reflect fast detection of aversive stimulus features.},

The results were compared to coherence measures. Differential patterns of significant changes of Dm estimates were found in the two emotional conditions. When compared to the neutral viewing condition, the emotionally negative experience provoked significant decreases of short- and long-distance ipsi- and contralateral Dm estimates that were more left-sided (with a `center of gravity' of Dm decrease at the F7 site), whereas the emotionally positive experience showed a pattern of symmetrically distributed ipsi- and contralateral increases of Dm estimates over central and posterior cortical regions (with `main processing nodes' of Dm increases at T5 and T6 sites). It is concluded that estimates of the mutual dimension are sensitive to subtle aspects of emotional processing, not accessible by linear (i.e. coherence) analyses.},

Unpleasant (compared to pleasant) music evoked a significant decrease of HR, replicating the pattern of HR responses previously described for the processing of emotional pictures, sounds, and films. In the EEG, pleasant (contrasted to unpleasant) music was associated with an increase of frontal midline (Fm) theta power. This effect is taken to reflect emotional processing in close interaction with attentional functions.

Each signal presentation was accompanied by subjective scaling of the extent of its emotional impact. EEG traces were recorded in 62 channels as signals were presented. These experiments showed that the degree of emotional impact of the signal was significantly associated with increases in evoked synchronization in the δ, θ1, θ2, β1, β3, and γ ranges and with the effects of combined changes in evoked synchronization and desynchronization in the α2 frequency range. The interhemisphere distribution of evoked changes in power provided evidence that not only the posterior areas of the right hemisphere were involved in analyzing the emotional significance of images, as indicated by changes in evoked θ1 and θ2 synchronization and α2 desynchronization, but also the anterior areas of the left hemisphere, as indicated by changes in evoked θ2 synchronization. From the standpoint of affective chronometry, the earliest discrimination of the emotional content of stimuli, regardless of the sign of the emotion, occurred in the lower θ range and was seen at 0--600 msec after the start of stimulus presentation. This process was delayed to 600--1000 msec in the θ2, α2, and γ ranges.},

	Abstract = {Affective phenomena, as reflected through brain activity, could constitute an effective index for the detection of music preference. In this vein, this paper focuses on the discrimination between subjects' electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to self-assessed liked or disliked music, acquired during an experimental procedure, by evaluating different feature extraction approaches and classifiers to this end. Feature extraction is based on time-frequency (TF) analysis by implementing three TF techniques, i.e., spectrogram, Zhao-Atlas-Marks distribution and Hilbert-Huang spectrum (HHS). Feature estimation also accounts for physiological parameters that relate to EEG frequency bands, reference states, time intervals, and hemispheric asymmetries. Classification is performed by employing four classifiers, i.e., support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), quadratic and Mahalanobis distance-based discriminant analyses. According to the experimental results across nine subjects, best classification accuracy 86.52 ($\pm$0.76)\% was achieved using k-NN and HHS-based feature vectors ( FVs) representing a bilateral average activity, referred to a resting period, in β (13-30 Hz) and γ (30-49 Hz) bands. Activity in these bands may point to a connection between music preference and emotional arousal phenomena. Furthermore, HHS-based FVs were found to be robust against noise corruption. The outcomes of this study provide early evidence and pave the way for the development of a generalized brain computer interface for music preference recognition.},

	Abstract = {In order to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms accompanying emotional valence judgements during listening to complex auditory stimuli, cortical direct current (dc)-electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns were recorded from 16 right-handed students. Students listened to 160 short sequences taken from the repertoires of jazz, rock-pop, classical music and environmental sounds (each n=40). Emotional valence of the perceived stimuli were rated on a 5-step scale after each sequence. Brain activation patterns during listening revealed widespread bilateral fronto-temporal activation, but a highly significant lateralisation effect: Positive emotional attributions were accompanied by an increase in left temporal activation, negative by a more bilateral pattern with preponderance of the right fronto-temporal cortex. Female participants demonstrated greater valence-related differences than males. No differences related to the four stimulus categories could be detected, suggesting that the actual auditory brain activation patterns were more determined by their affective emotional valence than by differences in acoustical ``fine'' structure. The results are consistent with a model of hemispheric specialisation concerning perceived positive or negative emotions proposed by Heilman [Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience 9 (1997) 439].},

	Abstract = {The dorsal convexity of the human frontal and parietal lobes forms a network that is crucially involved in the selection of sensory contents by attention. This network comprehends cortex along the intraparietal sulcus, the inferior parietal lobe, and dorsal premotor cortex, including the frontal eye field. These regions are richly interconnected with recurrent fibers passing through the superior longitudinal fasciculus. The posterior parietal cortex has several functional characteristics---such as feature-independent coding, enhancement of activity by attention, representation of task-related signals, and access to multiple reference frames---that point to a central role of this region in the computation of a feature- and modality-independent priority map of the environment. The priority map integrates feature information elaborated in sensory cortex and top-down representations of behavioral goals and expectations originating in the dorsolateral prefrontal and premotor cortex. This review presents converging evidence from single-unit studies of the primate brain, functional neuroimaging, and investigations of neuropsychological disorders such as B{\'a}lint syndrome and spatial neglect for a decisive role of the frontoparietal attention network in the selection of relevant environmental information.},

The aim of the study is to analyze the common and distinct parameters of affective picture perception in block and random designs by means of analysis of high frequency oscillatory dynamics (beta and gamma). EEG of 22 healthy subjects was recorded at 32 locations. The participants passively viewed 120 emotional pictures (10×4 unpleasant, 10×4 pleasant, 10×4 neutral) in block and random designs. The phase-locking and power of event related beta (14--28 Hz) and gamma (29--48 Hz) oscillations were analyzed for two different time windows (0--200 ms/200--400 ms). Statistical analysis showed that in the 0--200 ms time window, during the block design, unpleasant stimulation elicited higher beta phase-locking and beta power than the pleasant and neutral stimulation (p\&lt;0.05). In the 200--400 ms time window, during the block design, over occipital electrodes unpleasant stimulation elicited higher gamma response power than the pleasant stimulation and neutral stimulation (p\&lt;0.05). Unpleasant stimulation did not elicit higher beta or gamma responses in the random design. The present study showed that experimental design highly influences the perception of IAPS pictures. Unpleasant stimulation elicited higher event related beta and gamma phase-locking and power only in block design but not in random design. It seems that longer blocks of aversive pictures affect the brain more than the rapid observation of these pictures.},

	Abstract = {Evidence is reviewed to suggest that parietotemporal regions of the right hemisphere not only are specialized for the processing of emotional information but also play a critical role in the experience of emotion. In particular, it is argued that these regions of the right hemisphere constitute a system involved in modulating autonomic and behavioral arousal in emotional states. This system is characterized by a set of cognitive and attentional qualities that make it uniquely suited to respond to environmental events in an adaptive fashion. The current proposal is an elaboration of a model of emotion and brain organization (W. Heller, 1990) that incorporates several aspects of emotional function: (1) perception and production of emotional information, (2) mood and emotional experience, and (3) autonomic arousal. In the context of this model, it is suggested that the right-hemisphere system operates in conjunction with a system localized to the frontal lobes that is involved in modulating the emotional valence of experience. The interaction of these 2 systems is hypothesized to be conditioned by individual differences and developmental tendencies that contribute to the production of a unique and stable pattern of personality traits and emotional characteristics.

	Abstract = {Few studies directly examined the nature of hemispheric specialization and interaction in ADHD. The present experiment investigated left/right brain dynamics in unmedicated right handed adults with ADHD (n = 19) and in controls (n = 19), using a dichotic listening task to assess hemispheric differences in word and emotion recognition. We also assessed how focusing attention on a single ear modulated lateralized performance and affected cross-callosal interference effects. Analysis of variance indicated that ADHD subjects showed reduced left hemisphere specialization, were better at processing emotions, and worse at processing words compared to controls. These differences were eliminated during focused attention. Finally, during presumed right hemisphere processing of linguistic stimuli, subjects with ADHD showed reduced left hemisphere interference. We concluded that ADHD subjects demonstrated greater right hemisphere and reduced left hemisphere contribution during this task relative to controls. We posit that these hemispheric differences were due to management or use of available cognitive resources rather than inherent capacity.},

The first examines hemispheric asymmetries in frontal function; the second focuses on prefrontal interactions between cognition and emotion. We briefly review each perspective and highlight inconsistencies between them. We go on to describe an alternative model that integrates approaches by focusing on hemispheric asymmetry in inhibitory executive control processes. The asymmetric inhibition model proposes that right-lateralized executive control inhibits processing of positive or approach-related distractors, and left-lateralized control inhibits negative or withdrawal-related distractors. These complementary processes allow us to maintain and achieve current goals in the face of emotional distraction. We conclude with a research agenda that uses the model to generate novel experiments that will advance our understanding of both hemispheric asymmetries and cognition-emotion interactions.},

We found that baseline measures of right frontal asymmetry were a significant predictor of empathic concern, a relationship that was mediated by feelings of sadness. These results provide a more complex view of right frontal asymmetry and suggest that this pattern of brain activity might facilitate sensitivity towards the suffering of others.},

	Abstract = {According to previous results, negative emotional facial expressions elicit oscillatory beta responses. The present study analyzes event-related beta oscillations upon presentation of International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and aims to show whether behavior of beta in response to negative IAPS pictures also have similar dynamics. IAPS pictures (unpleasant, pleasant, and neutral) were presented as a block and random passive viewing to 14 healthy subjects (8 male). Only with pictures with similar luminance level were selected as stimuli. Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 30 different scalp locations, and adaptive digital filtering was used for analysis in different frequency windows. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes were measured for each subject's averaged beta responses (15--30 Hz) in the 0 and 300 ms time window. Beta responses were significantly higher for unpleasant pictures than for pleasant and neutral pictures (average 50\%). Beta responses were significantly higher for unpleasant than for pleasant pictures over frontal, central and parietal electrode sides (p \&lt; 0.05). Furthermore, beta responses were significantly higher for unpleasant than for neutral pictures over parietal and occipital electrodes (p \&lt; 0.04). In addition, the pleasant pictures elicited higher beta responses than neutral pictures over occipital electrode sites (p \&lt; 0.04). The results of the present study indicate that negative emotions are related to increased beta responses in humans, independent of stimulus types (facial expression or IAPS pictures). Accordingly, beta responses to negative emotions are possibly a common phenomenon. The standardization of luminance in pictures may reduce divergences between results from different laboratories.},

In the analyzed population, maps of Power spectral density (PSD) showed an asymmetrical increase of theta and alpha activity related to the observation of pleasant (unpleasant) advertisements in the left (right) hemisphere. A correlation analysis revealed that the increase of PSD at left frontal sites is negatively correlated with the degree of pleasantness perceived. Conversely, the de-synchronization of left alpha frontal activity is positively correlated with judgments of high pleasantness. Moreover, our data presented an increase of PSD related to the observation of unpleasant commercials, which resulted higher with respect to the one elicited by pleasant advertisements.},

Although considerable progress has occurred since the first report on this topic 25 years ago, research on frontal EEG asymmetries associated with affect has largely evolved in the absence of any serious connection with neuroscience research on the structure and function of the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC). Such integration is important as this work progresses since the neuroscience literature can help to understand what the prefrontal cortex is ``doing'' in affective processing. Data from the neuroscience literature on the heterogeneity of different sectors of the PFC are introduced and more specific hypotheses are offered about what different sectors of the PFC might be doing in affect.

However, the parietal cortex also seems to play a role in motivation and emotion. In the present study the lateralized role of the parietal cortex in motivated attention was investigated, using an electrophysiological correlate of brain activity (electroencephalogram (EEG)) and a modified Dot probe task, which indexes selective, i.e. avoidant or vigilant attention for angry faces in a spatial display. Twenty-two participants underwent an EEG baseline recording from the F3, F4, P3 and P4 electrode positions, which was followed by the modified Dot probe task. Spectral power in 1 Hz frequency bins were derived for each electrode site and transformed to power density values in the 8--12 Hz (alpha) and 13--30 Hz (beta) frequency range. Log-transformed prefrontal and parietal asymmetries and bias scores for selective attention to angry and happy faces were calculated. Results showed a highly significant relationship between the asymmetry in parietal EEG beta activity and the attentional response to the angry face. Relative more right-sided parietal EEG activity in the beta frequency domain was predictive of a more avoidant response to angry facial expression. This finding suggests that asymmetrical parietal beta activity might be linked to the behavioural dimensions of approach and withdrawal.},

	Abstract = {Pain is a multidimensional phenomenon. Previous psychological studies have shown that a person's subjective pain threshold can change when certain emotions are recognized. We examined this association with magnetoencephalography. Magnetic field strength was recorded with a 306-channel neuromagnetometer while 19 healthy subjects (7 female, 12 male; age range = 20--30 years) experienced pain stimuli in different emotional contexts induced by the presentation of sad, happy, or neutral facial stimuli. Subjects also rated their subjective pain intensity. We hypothesized that pain stimuli were affected by sadness induced by facial recognition. We found: 1) the intensity of subjective pain ratings increased in the sad emotional context compared to the happy and the neutral contexts, and 2) event-related desynchronization of lower beta bands in the right hemisphere after pain stimuli was larger in the sad emotional condition than in the happy emotional condition. Previous studies have shown that event-related desynchronization in these bands could be consistently observed over the primary somatosensory cortex. These findings suggest that sadness can modulate neural responses to pain stimuli, and that brain processing of pain stimuli had already been affected, at the level of the primary somatosensory cortex, which is critical for sensory processing of pain. Perspective We found that subjective pain ratings and cortical beta rhythms after pain stimuli are influenced by the sad emotional context. These results may contribute to understanding the broader relationship between pain and negative emotion.},

	Abstract = {Single painful stimuli evoke two successive and qualitatively distinct sensations referred to as first and second pain sensation. Peripherally, the neural basis of this phenomenon is a dual pathway for pain with Aδ and C fibers mediating first and second pain, respectively. Yet, the differential cortical correlates of both sensations are largely unknown. We therefore used magnetoencephalography to record and directly compare first and second pain-related cortical responses to cutaneous laser stimuli in humans. Our results show that brief painful stimuli evoke sustained cortical activity corresponding to sustained pain perception comprising early first pain-related and late second pain-related components. Cortical activity was located in primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices and anterior cingulate cortex. Time courses of activations disclosed that first pain was particularly related to activation of S1 whereas second pain was closely related to anterior cingulate cortex activation. Both sensations were associated with S2 activation. These results correspond to the different perceptual characteristics of both sensations and probably reflect different biological functions of first and second pain. First pain signals threat and provides precise sensory information for an immediate withdrawal, whereas second pain attracts longer-lasting attention and motivates behavioral responses to limit further injury and optimize recovery.},

However, relatively little is known about how hedonic valence of touch is processed at the cortical level. Here we investigated the electrophysiological correlates of affective tactile sensation during caressing of the right forearm with pleasant and unpleasant textile fabrics. We show dissociation between more physically driven differential brain responses to the different fabrics in early somatosensory cortex -- the well-known mu-suppression (10--20 Hz) -- and a beta-band response (25--30 Hz) in presumably higher-order somatosensory areas in the right hemisphere that correlated well with the subjective valence of tactile caressing. Importantly, when using single trial classification techniques, beta-power significantly distinguished between pleasant and unpleasant stimulation on a single trial basis with high accuracy. Our results therefore suggest a dissociation of the sensory and affective aspects of touch in the somatosensory system and may provide features that may be used for single trial decoding of affective mental states from simple electroencephalographic measurements.},

	Abstract = {A common view of consciousness is that our mind presents emotions, experiences, and images in an internal mental (re-)presentation space which in a state of wakefulness is triggered by the world outside. Consciousness can be defined as the observation of this inner mental space. We propose a new model, in which the state of the conscious observer is defined by the observer's mental position and focus of attention. The mental position of the observer can either be within the mental self (intrapersonal space), in the mental outer world (extrapersonal space) or in an empathic connection, i.e., within the intrapersonal space of another person (perspective taking). The focus of attention can be directed toward the self or toward the outside world. This mental space model can help us to understand the patterns of relationships and interactions with other persons as they occur in social life. To investigate the neurophysiological correlates and discriminability of the different mental states, we conducted an EEG experiment measuring the brain activity of 16 subjects via 64 electrodes while they engaged in different mental positions (intrapersonal, extrapersonal, perspective taking) with different attentional foci (self, object). Compared to external mental locations, internal ones showed significantly increased alpha2 power, especially when the observer was focusing on an object. Alpha2 and beta2 were increased in the empathic condition compared to the extrapersonal perspective. Delta power was significantly higher when the attentional focus was directed toward an object in comparison to the participant's own self. This exploratory study demonstrates highly significant differences between various mental locations and foci, suggesting that the proposed categories of mental location and intra- and interpersonal attentional foci are not only helpful theoretical concepts but are also physiologically relevant and therefore may relate to basic brain processing mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Many brain regions are involved in smoking addiction (e.g. insula, ventral tegmental area, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus), and the manipulation of the activity of these brain regions can show a modification of smoking behavior. Low current transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive way to manipulate cortical excitability, and thus brain function and associated behaviors. In this study, we examined the effects of inhibiting the frontal-parietal-temporal association area (FPT) on attention bias to smoking-related cues and smoking behavior in tobacco users. This inhibition is induced by cathodal tDCS stimulation. We tested three stimulation conditions: 1) bilateral cathodal over both sides of FPT; 2) cathodal over right FPT; and 3) sham-tDCS. Visual attention bias to smoking-related cues was evaluated using an eye tracking system. The measurement for smoking behavior was the number of daily cigarettes consumed before and after tDCS treatment. We found that, after bilateral cathodal stimulation of the FPT area, while the attention to smoking-related cues showed a decreased trend, the effects were not significantly different from sham stimulation. The daily cigarette consumption was reduced to a significant level. These effects were not seen under single cathodal tDCS or sham-tDCS. Our results show that low current tDCS of FPT area attenuates smoking cue-related attention and smoking behavior. This non-invasive brain stimulation technique, targeted at FPT areas, might be a promising method for treating smoking behavior.},

	Abstract = {Empathy is a multi-dimensional concept allowing humans to understand the emotions of others and respond adaptively from a social perspective. This mental process, essential to social interactions, has attracted the attention of many scholars from different fields of study but the blooming interest for empathy in cognitive neurosciences has rekindled this interest. This paper reviews the growing literature stemming from studies using brain stimulation techniques that have investigated directly or indirectly the different components of empathy, including resonance, self-other discrimination, and mentalizing. Some studies have also ventured toward the modulation of this complex process and toward the investigation of different components in populations that show reduced empathic skills. We argue that brain stimulation techniques have the potential to make a unique contribution to the field of empathy research with their exclusive capacity, compared to other brain imaging techniques, to modulate the neural systems involved in the distinct components of this process. Provided the development of innovative ecological paradigms that will put people in actual social interactions as well as comprehensive and adaptive models that can integrate research from different domains, the ultimate goal of this research domain is to devise protocols that can modulate empathy in people with developmental, neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a neuromodulation approach that targets peripheral nerves and utilizes their afferents as signaling conduits to influence brain function. We investigated the effects of this transdermal electrical neurosignaling (TEN) approach on physiological responses to acute stress induction. TEN was targeted to the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the right trigeminal nerve and cervical spinal nerve afferents (C2/C3) using high-frequency, pulse-modulated electrical currents. Compared to active sham stimulation, TEN significantly suppressed sympathetic activity in response to acute stress without impeding cognitive performance. This sympatholytic action of TEN was indicated by significant suppression of heart rate variability changes, galvanic skin responses, and salivary α-amylase levels in response to stress. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that TEN acted partially by modulating activity in the locus coeruleus and subsequent noradrenergic signaling. Dampening sympathetic tone using TEN in such a manner represents a promising approach to managing daily stress and improving brain health.},

	Abstract = {Addiction is a devastating and chronically relapsing disorder. Repeated drug administration induces neuroadaptations associated with abnormal dopaminergic activity in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry, resulting in altered cortical neurotransmission and excitability. Electrical stimulation of specific brain regions can be used in animal models and humans to induce local activation or disruption of specific circuitries or alter neuronal excitability and cause neuroadaptations. Non-surgical stimulation of specific brain regions in human addicts can be achieved by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is used for transient stimulation or disruption of neural activity in specific cortical regions, which can be used to assess cortical excitability, and to induce changes in cortical excitability. Moreover, it is suggested that repeated stimulation can cause long-lasting neuroadaptations. Therefore, TMS paradigms were used in some studies to assess the presence of altered cortical excitability associated with chronic drug consumption, while other studies have begun to assess the therapeutic potential of repetitive TMS. Similarly, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used to modulate neuronal resting membrane potential in humans and alter cortical excitability. The current review describes how these brain stimulation techniques have recently been used for the study and treatment of addiction in animal models and humans.},

	Abstract = {Automatic emotion recognition is one of the most challenging tasks. To detect emotion from nonstationary EEG signals, a sophisticated learning algorithm that can represent high-level abstraction is required. This study proposes the utilization of a deep learning network (DLN) to discover unknown feature correlation between input signals that is crucial for the learning task. The DLN is implemented with a stacked autoencoder (SAE) using hierarchical feature learning approach. Input features of the network are power spectral densities of 32-channel EEG signals from 32 subjects. To alleviate overfitting problem, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to extract the most important components of initial input features. Furthermore, covariate shift adaptation of the principal components is implemented to minimize the nonstationary effect of EEG signals. Experimental results show that the DLN is capable of classifying three different levels of valence and arousal with accuracy of 49.52\&\#x25; and 46.03\&\#x25;, respectively. Principal component based covariate shift adaptation enhances the respective classification accuracy by 5.55\&\#x25; and 6.53\&\#x25;. Moreover, DLN provides better performance compared to SVM and naive Bayes classifiers.},

	Abstract = {Phase synchronization among neuronal oscillations within the same frequency band has been hypothesized to be a major mechanism for communication between different brain areas. On the other hand, cross-frequency communications are more flexible allowing interactions between oscillations with different frequencies. Among such cross-frequency interactions amplitude-to-amplitude interactions are of a special interest as they show how the strength of spatial synchronization in different neuronal populations relates to each other during a given task. While, previously, amplitude-to-amplitude correlations were studied primarily on the sensor level, we present a source separation approach using spatial filters which maximize the correlation between the envelopes of brain oscillations recorded with electro-/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) or intracranial multichannel recordings. Our approach, which is called canonical source power correlation analysis (cSPoC), is thereby capable of extracting genuine brain oscillations solely based on their assumed coupling behavior even when the signal-to-noise ratio of the signals is low. In addition to using cSPoC for the analysis of cross-frequency interactions in the same subject, we show that it can also be utilized for studying amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations across subjects. We assess the performance of cSPoC in simulations as well as in three distinctively different analysis scenarios of real EEG data, each involving several subjects. In the simulations, cSPoC outperforms unsupervised state-of-the-art approaches. In the analysis of real EEG recordings, we demonstrate excellent unsupervised discovery of meaningful power-to-power couplings, within as well as across subjects and frequency bands.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a toolbox and graphic user interface, EEGLAB, running under the crossplatform MATLAB environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) for processing collections of single-trial and/or averaged EEG data of any number of channels. Available functions include EEG data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive `pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A `plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu. EEGLAB is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the GNU public license for noncommercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.},

@article{eerola_comparison_2011,
	Abstract = {The primary aim of the present study was to systematically compare perceived emotions in music using two different theoretical frameworks: The discrete emotion model, and the dimensional model of affect. A secondary aim was to introduce a new, improved set of stimuli for the study of music-mediated emotions. A large pilot study established a set of 110 film music excerpts, half were moderately and highly representative examples of five discrete emotions (anger, fear, sadness, happiness and tenderness), and the other half moderate and high examples of the six extremes of three bipolar dimensions (valence, energy arousal and tension arousal). These excerpts were rated in a listening experiment by 116 non-musicians. All target emotions of highly representative examples in both conceptual sets were discriminated by self-ratings. Linear mapping techniques between the discrete and dimensional models revealed a high correspondence along two central dimensions that can be labelled as valence and arousal, and the three dimensions could be reduced to two without significantly reducing the goodness of fit. The major difference between the discrete and categorical models concerned the poorer resolution of the discrete model in characterizing emotionally ambiguous examples. The study offers systematically structured and rich stimulus material for exploring emotional processing.},

	Abstract = {The differentiation of faces, facial expressions and affective pictures involves processes of higher mental activity that have considerable applications in the psychology of moods and emotions. At present, the search for functional correlates of brain oscillations is an important trend in neuroscience. Furthermore, analyses of oscillatory responses provide key knowledge on the physiology of brain dynamics. Studies analysing oscillatory dynamics in face perception and emotional pictures have increased in recent years; however, the literature lacks a review of the current state of the art. This study provides a comprehensive review of the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma oscillatory responses on presentation of faces, facial expressions and affective pictures (International Affective Picture System, IAPS). The reviewed literature revealed that the brain is more sensitive to emotional stimuli than neutral stimuli. A common and reliable finding from all reviewed studies was the increased brain responsiveness towards negative emotional pictures (face expression or IAPS).},

@inproceedings{haufe_parameter_2014,
	Abstract = {Neuroimaging data are frequently analyzed with multivariate methods. Models expressing the data as a function of underlying factors related to the brain processes under study (signals) are called forward models, while models reversing this functional relationship are called backward models. Weigth vectors of backward models (called extraction filters) indicate the measurement channels informative with respect to isolating the signals. However, being a function of both signal and noise, significant weights may be observed at channels containing pure noise, while a proportion of signal-related channels may be given zero or insignificant weight. In contrast, forward model parameters (activation patterns) may exhibit significant weights only at signal-related channels, and are therefore interpretable with respect to the origin of the brain processes under study. It is sometimes incorrectly assumed that regularization (e.g., sparsification) of backward models makes extraction filters interpretable in the same sense. However, by transforming filters into patterns of corresponding forward models, as outlined here for the linear case, this can be indeed achieved. While these considerations hold for all types of data, the distinction between filters and patterns is particularly crucial for EEG and MEG data: Only activation patterns can be localized to brain anatomy using customary inverse methods. We illustrate our theoretical results using a real EEG data example.},

	Abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical method for transforming an observed multidimensional random vector into components that are statistically as independent from each other as possible. We use a combination of two different approaches for linear ICA: Comon's information theoretic approach and the projection pursuit approach. Using maximum entropy approximations of differential entropy, we introduce a family of new contrast functions for ICA. These contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of individual independent components as projection pursuit directions. The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance. Finally, we introduce simple fixed-point algorithms for practical optimization of the contrast functions},

@article{nikulin_novel_2011,
	Abstract = {Neuronal oscillations have been shown to underlie various cognitive, perceptual and motor functions in the brain. However, studying these oscillations is notoriously difficult with EEG/MEG recordings due to a massive overlap of activity from multiple sources and also due to the strong background noise. Here we present a novel method for the reliable and fast extraction of neuronal oscillations from multi-channel EEG/MEG/LFP recordings. The method is based on a linear decomposition of recordings: It maximizes the signal power at a peak frequency while simultaneously minimizing it at the neighboring, surrounding frequency bins. Such procedure leads to the optimization of signal-to-noise ratio and allows extraction of components with a characteristic ``peaky'' spectral profile, which is typical for oscillatory processes. We refer to this method as spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD). Our simulations demonstrate that the method allows extraction of oscillatory signals even with a signal-to-noise ratio as low as 1:10. The SSD also outperformed conventional approaches based on independent component analysis. Using real EEG data we also show that SSD allows extraction of neuronal oscillations (e.g., in alpha frequency range) with high signal-to-noise ratio and with the spatial patterns corresponding to central and occipito-parietal sources. Importantly, running time for SSD is only a few milliseconds, which clearly distinguishes it from other extraction techniques usually requiring minutes or even hours of computational time. Due to the high accuracy and speed, we suggest that SSD can be used as a reliable method for the extraction of neuronal oscillations from multi-channel electrophysiological recordings.},
